# chef-elefant

## Description

This is a [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) recipe for installing
the [Elefant CMS](http://www.elefantcms.com/) and associated LAMP stack
(Apache2, MySQL, SQLite, and PHP).

## Requirements

### Platform

* Debian, Ubuntu

Tested on:

* Ubuntu 12.04

### Cookbooks

* mysql
* php
* apache2
* openssl

### Permissions

Elefant requires write permissions on certain folders such as the `cache` folder,
but deploying to a VirtualBox virtual machine currently has the limitation that
you can't modify synced folder permissions. The workaround is to set the `:nfs => true`
flag on the `config.vm.synced_folder` setting like this:

```ruby
config.vm.synced_folder "www", "/var/www/elefant", :nfs => true
```

This also has the benefit of being generally faster than the default synced folders.

Unfortunately, NFS is not supported on Windows. Windows users may want to try the
[Vagrant::Mirror](https://github.com/ingenerator/vagrant-mirror) plugin, although
I have not tested whether it will work. If you get it running, please consider
sharing the steps it took to help others.

Note that NFS support also requires root privileges on the host machine, as the
`vagrant up` command will request your administrative privileges in order to modify
`/etc/exports` and to restart the NFS server daemon.

## Attributes

* `node['elefant']['version']` - Set the version to download. Using 'latest' (the default) will install from the latest master on Github. Use underscores instead of spaces in the version name (e.g., '1_3_6_beta')
* `node['elefant']['document_root']` - Set the location to place the Elefant files. Default is `/var/www/elefant`.
* `node['elefant']['server_aliases']` - Array of ServerAliases to add to the Apache vhost. Default is `*`.

## Usage

Add the "elefant" recipe to your node's run list or role, or include the recipe in another cookbook.
To add this recipe, clone this repository into your cookbooks folder and name the folder 'elefant'.

Chef will also install and configure the mysql, php, and apache2 recipes in addition to Elefant.

To complete the installation, visit `http://hostname/install/` (change the hostname if you change the attribute values).

## Sample Vagrantfile

Here is a sample Vagrantfile you can use to quickly get Elefant running:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "precise64"

  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.56.101"

  config.vm.synced_folder "www", "/var/www/elefant", :nfs => true

  config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|
  	chef.cookbooks_path = "chef/cookbooks"
    chef.roles_path = "chef/roles"
    chef.data_bags_path = "chef/data_bags"
    chef.add_recipe "vim"
    chef.add_recipe "postfix"
    chef.add_recipe "mysql::server"
    chef.add_recipe "sqlite"
    chef.add_recipe "php"
    chef.add_recipe "php::module_mysql"
    chef.add_recipe "php::module_curl"
    chef.add_recipe "php::module_gd"
    chef.add_recipe "php::module_memcache"
    chef.add_recipe "php::module_sqlite3"
    chef.add_recipe "apache2"
    chef.add_recipe "elefant"

    chef.json = {
      :mysql => {
        :server_debian_password => "change-me",
        :server_root_password   => "change-me",
        :server_repl_password   => "change-me"
      }
    }
  end
end
```
